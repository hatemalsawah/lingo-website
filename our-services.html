                The world economy is becoming increasingly integrated in all business sectors and markets, and without accurate information and communication, this level of information flow would be impossible to track.<br> Additionally, English is no longer the only language for business with the Middle East becoming a beacon for investment, translation into Arabic is essential.<br><br>

that as it has the financial expertise and specialist language professionals to make your next
project a success.<br>

                Mobile marketing is set to be one of the most important drivers for change in the way that prospective customers will be engaging with businesses in the future, and no marketer can afford to ignore the need for mobile marketing translation if their goal is to reach new markets.<br><br>

                The huge recent uptake of smart-phones is of course driving the rapid expansion into these areas, and there is clearly an opportunity for businesses of all sizes to get ahead of the competition by staking out an internet presence in the mobile market, and mobile marketing translation can help build your online presence.<br>

                Localizing your software into Arabic will allow you to tap into new markets, and give your Arabic-speaking users a better experience. But it can be a challenge if you don’t have the right processes and technology in place. PrimeLingo’s expert team of translators can provide you with software localization services for all types of software packages. Whether you are creating a new operating system or an internal software package for companies’ overseas office, we can help.<br><br>

At PrimeLingo, we translate computer software, games, and online applications from English into
Arabic. Taking speed, quality, and cost into consideration when localizing your software is what
makes us the perfect choice for you to use our services.

                Website Localization</h4>
            <p >
                The process of adapting the language, appearance and functionality of a website for the Arabic markets needs someone expert with a great grasp on Arabic cultural business fields and marketing strategies, PrimeLingo can do this and more. Because we do more than translate your content; we help you reach your target audiences without losing your identity or style.<br><br>

One of PrimeLingo’s strategic goals is to help businesses expand in Arabic-speaking countries. When a brand aspires to spread, translation is the only solution, but poor, non-localized translation can cause great harm as well as embarrassment. So we work very carefully to ensure
that the end goal of the localization is a website that:  <br>  
                       <ul>
              <li class="mission">Accommodates the differences in cultures and terminologies</li>
              <li class="mission"> Stay true to the original content
            </li>
              <li class="mission"> Reads like it was designed in the target language in the first place </li>

            <p >
                As you know marketing material is not only supposed to convey a message but also to persuade the reader. Therefore, marketing translations are particularly challenging because they need a higher level of creativity compared to technical or medical translation, but with our qualified and professional team we ensure that whatever you’re trying to convey through your marketing channels we’ll help you say it to the world.<br><br>

We provide fast translation services of various types of marketing materials like paper advertisement, TV advertisement, all the collateral that goes with the promotion of a company
(leaflets, presentation, even business cards), and all the content that lives online, that includes Content
Marketing, online advertisement (PPC campaigns and banners creation), SEO and email marketing just
to name the main categories.

                Translating general documents that can’t be categorized under a specific industry and don’t require any specialized knowledge, seems easy on the surface but in fact it can be tricky, because the same document can contain terminology from multiple sectors like news articles, job applications and so on; so it needs a very skilled and knowledgeable translator to get it right and you’ll find that translator at PrimeLingo.<br><br>

Whatever your document is, PrimeLingo can translate it. We have a very qualified team with expertise in various fields of translation and localization, whether it’s Press Releases, slogans,
travelogues, advertisements, brochures, letters, books, instructions, etc; depend on us to get it done.
